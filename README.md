# Gold Rush Price Calculator
A Simple React/Node/Express/MySQL CRUD app to calculate the prices of products in one of my favourite video games.
While the project itself isn't really large enough to fully take advantage of React's capabilities, I decided to use it purely to improve my understanding of the various
tools involved.
## Functionality
This web app will eventually allow users to enter a list of (in-game) products they wish to buy, the day of the (virtual) year they intend to buy them on, and will return the total (virtual) cost.
## Implementation
A form - in a similar style to the "buy" menu in the game itself - will be used to select the products. Various drop-downs and checkboxes will be used to select other parameters (the exact layout and scope of these is still TBC). The product and price information will be pulled from an SQL database running on the Node server (using Express.js). The summation and calculations will be carried out on the client side.

##Notes
This project is currently incomplete, and the quality and structure of the code included may not reflect that of the final release. Again, this is an experiment project for me, I have little prior knowledge of React and Express.js.
